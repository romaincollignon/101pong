## :rocket: Introduction

    Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever
    successful video game.
    It was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in    
    1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.
    The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the 
    reakout game. . . ).
    Only one paddle will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is
    defined by the equation z = 0).
